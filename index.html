            <img src="images/ash_stairs.jpg" width = "400" alt="Ash in zipper">

            <p>Ash is a black cat that roams my apartment hallways. He's somehow always ready to greet me or my roommate and likes to run down the stairs to say Hi.</p> 
            <P>If we're not fast enough, he will run into our apartment and hide somewhere. Ash won the cutest pet for our apartments, and I'm inclined to agree.</P>

            <img src="images/rocket_primary.jpg" width = "500" alt="puppy sees camera">

            <p>Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose. Rocket is named rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to carry his little toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.</p> 
            <P>Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will "say hi" to you after a few seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are hard for him to smell lol. If you meet rocket, donâ€™t hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.</P>

            <img src="images/cody.jpg" width = "400" alt="puppy cody">

            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make friends with other doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.</p> 
            <P>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</P>

            <h2>Chako</h2>
            <img src="images/Chako1.jpg" width = "400" alt="puppy's portrait">

            <p>With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, he seemed to embody both the mystery and the exuberance of life itself. Agile and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were his personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity.</p> 
            <P>Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. He would curl up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, as if solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene, Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities, teaching his human companions that one could be many things all at once.</P>

            <p>Milo is a high maintenance, lazy dog who prefers lounging over running. His favorite food to eat is Indian food, and he loves anything with chicken in it. He especially loves chicken, but it must be marinated and seasoned.</p>
